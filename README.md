# 3DVectors
Finding the Dot Product(Scalar product) and Cross Product(Vector Product) of two 3 Dimension vectors.<br>
## What is dot product<br>
Dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding direction vectors<br>
It is also the cosine of the angle between those vectors.
## What is cross product<br>
Cross product of a vector is a third vector which is orthogonal to the vectors multiplied.
